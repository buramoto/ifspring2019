		<h1>Feedback for Claire Huang</h1>
		<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>
				The cards really stood out, especially since they were on a black background, and the cards themselves are white. I especially like that the text on the images goes along with the color scheme of the artwork, and not black like the rest of the background. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The sharp edges of the border I think could change a little to be rounded so that it would sort of match the paintbrush/hand style of the artwork. 
			</li>
			<li>
				I am unfamiliar with the origins and the authors of the quotes, but I think the pictures have some relation with the quotes. Perhaps add a small description of the author at the end of each, just after the name?
			</li>
			<li>
				The design is consistent with the text and the same art style is used for each.
			</li>
			<li>
				The aesthetic artwork seems to be the driving concept of the quote.
			</li>
			<li>
				The wording is very legible.
			</li>
			<li>
				Overall, the piece works well with all of its elements, and nothing seems to be subtracting from the look of the cards. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Structure</h2>
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>
				The main focus of the cardâ€™s design is the artwork on each other cards. I admire the way the picture sort of hangs off of the card and runs into the edge. I think this is good because it makes the card seem bigger.
			</li>
			<li>
				With the color contrast with the black and white, the color of the paintings draws my attention a little more than the words.
			</li>
			<li>
				The bard and the sandworm quote make me think that the text of the quote is in the foreground and the picture is in the background. I think this is because of the size of the text. In the last quote, I think that the artwork is in the foreground. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The background contrast design should work well on any platform for the user.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>
				When the screen shrinks, the entire picture scales, and the text at the top gets justified to the left of the screen in a column.
			</li>
			<li>
				Since the quote is part of the picture, the text will not collide with the picture. There is no danger of clashing
			</li>
		</ul>
