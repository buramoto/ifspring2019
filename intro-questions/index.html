		<h1>Introduction Questions Answered</h1>

			<li>Brent Uramoto, Computer Engineering, Sophomore</li>
			<li>Although I am a computer engineering major, I have chosen to take a minor in design. I am very interested in using technology to tell a story or create an interactive and immersive experience. This class was particularly interesting because it combines my engineering background and design thinking</li>
			<li>I do not have any experience in HTML, CSS, OR JS</li>
			<li>I hope to learn different elements and tatics that encourage users to interact with our project. I would also like to learn which parts need to be purely fuctional and others which can be aesthetic</li>
			<li>With a screen, I expect to have a lot more content available to the user. On paper, the image or design is static, but a screen can shift and display anything at any time. The screen can provide a more intimate experience through interactions. I think the screen can be treated like many sheets of paper that compliment themselves</li>
			<li>I think <a href="http://www.painacafe.com/#about-us">Paina Cafe</a>'s website is a good example of design. When you first load into the site, their logo is displayed in the top left of the page, usually the starting place of reading a book. They also have a navigation bar with links to pages that people often look for, like the menu and locations. The next part that catches our eye is the big pictures in the background, showing their signature dishes, close up. I think this is to give the user a hungry feeling to buy their food. Further down the page, they have maps to where their locations are, to help the user find a store. Finally, at the bottom they have the addresses of their stores, their phone numbers, and the hours which they are open</li>
			<li><a href="https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Tutorials">GNU Radio Tutorial</a> is a website that I think communicates effectively. This is just the link to the front page, but if you go into one of the beginner tutorials, it is done very well. This website has good communication because it uses a mix of words, pictures and even videos to teach the user how to use the GNU Radio software. I have used this site to help me understand the program and create a presentation at the end of the semester</li>
			<li>One website that works well is my <a href="https://www.punahou.edu/">old high school's website</a>. This website works well because it combines visual elements such as the color pallet, pictures, and video with functional pieces like links to stories, admissions and news. The flow of the site is smooth as well. As the user scrolls down the site, they learn what Punahou is, what students do during their day, stories about events, and finally, when they get to the bottom of the page, how to visit and contact them</li>
