		<h1>Feedback for Brent's Recipe Page</h1>
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>
				The title text blends too much with the background picture, so it would be good if I could make the text black or another dark color.
			</li>
			<li>
				The words are a little close to the edge, so I should make the text columns smaller so the text does not get too close to the screen.

			</li>
			<li>
				I should asjust my sources cited section, as the white space seems like an error. I could color it or make it more noticeable so it doesn't look like a mistake.
			</li>
			<li>
				I should probably add some sort of quanitity so that my recipe is more complete and easier to follow.
			</li>
			<li>
				It was suggested that I change the text for the cook and prep times so that they match the instructions and other text.
			</li>
			<li>
				I should adjust the spacing of the picture at the bottom so that the transition to the bottom of the page is not jarring.
			</li>
			<li>
				The colors on my website clash with each other, so I could choose two colors and hanve the sections alternate between the two colors.
			</li>
			<li>
				It was also suggested that I make the text a little bigger so it is easier to see from farther away.
			</li>
		</ul>
