		<h1>Feedback for Brent's Recipe Website Wireframe</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The background image should be more transparent to increase the contrast of the text. If the colors of the text and the picture are too similar, it will be hard to distinguish the words. I am still playing around with the transparancy. (see below) 
			</li>
			<li>
				It was suggested that I put a border/colored box around my sections of ingredients and procedure to make them stand out more. I think this is a good idea and will help the user identify the different sections and navigate easily.
			</li>
			<li>
				Recommended to be a simpler font like Ariel because there are lot of instructions on recipe. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The picture between ingredients and procedure should be of procedure because ingredients are self-explanatory.
			</li>
